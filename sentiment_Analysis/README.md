## Bert_sentiment_analysis.ipynb:
      is the python code used for model building, since i could not upload the saved model due to space restrictions, just run the code and the model will be saved.
## Beart_call.ipynb:
      can be used to call the bert saved model.

P.S. on different computers directories will be different so must take care of that.
