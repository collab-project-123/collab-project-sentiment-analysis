"Live: Can Nifty defend 25,000 amid global selloff? Ola Electric IPO opens | Opening Bell","Indian equity market opened with a gap-up above the 25,000 milestone. Despite gradually losing momentum, the Nifty50 index concluded the session on a positive note, managing to settle above the 25,000 mark for the first time. However, the market breadth remains restrained, with limited support from the bulls, indicating a sign of timidity. From a technical standpoint, for Nifty, 24,800 remains the crucial support zone, where buying is anticipated to emerge, followed by the sacrosanct support of the 24,600-24,500 zone. On the higher end, as per experts, 25,080-25,100 appears to be an intermediate obstacle. However, this morning global cues are extremely weak with Nasdaq tumbling over 2% overnight and Nikkei clocking deep cuts of ove 5%. The GIFT Nifty is also hinting at a negative start for the Indian market. Among stocks in focus, watch out for Tata Motors, ITC, Eicher, Hero Moto, Titan & Britannia.
