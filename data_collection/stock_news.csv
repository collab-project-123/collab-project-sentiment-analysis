Adani shares in focus|Opening Bell,"Indian equity market closed one percent higher after a gap-up opening on Friday but failed to sustain above the short-term moving averages (10 and 21-day EMA), which coincides with the 24,400 mark.

"Live: Can Nifty defend 25,000 amid global selloff? Ola Electric IPO opens | Opening Bell","Indian equity market opened with a gap-up above the 25,000 milestone. Despite gradually losing momentum, the Nifty50 index concluded the session on a positive note, managing to settle above the 25,000 mark for the first time. However, the market breadth remains restrained, with limited support from the bulls, indicating a sign of timidity. From a technical standpoint, for Nifty, 24,800 remains the crucial support zone, where buying is anticipated to emerge, followed by the sacrosanct support of the 24,600-24,500 zone. On the higher end, as per experts, 25,080-25,100 appears to be an intermediate obstacle. However, this morning global cues are extremely weak with Nasdaq tumbling over 2% overnight and Nikkei clocking deep cuts of ove 5%. The GIFT Nifty is also hinting at a negative start for the Indian market. Among stocks in focus, watch out for Tata Motors, ITC, Eicher, Hero Moto, Titan & Britannia.

On the higher end, as per experts, 25,080-25,100 appears to be an intermediate obstacle. However, this morning global cues are extremely weak with Nasdaq tumbling over 2% overnight and Nikkei clocking deep cuts of ove 5%.

Despite gradually losing momentum, the Nifty50 index concluded the session on a positive note, managing to settle above the 25,000 mark for the first time. However, the market breadth remains restrained, with limited support from the bulls, indicating a sign of timidity.

On the higher end, as per experts, 25,080-25,100 appears to be an intermediate obstacle. However, this morning global cues are extremely weak with Nasdaq tumbling over 2% overnight and Nikkei clocking deep cuts of ove 5%.

"Live: Can Nifty defend 25,000 amid global selloff? Ola Electric IPO opens | Opening Bell","Indian equity market opened with a gap-up above the 25,000 milestone. Despite gradually losing momentum, the Nifty50 index concluded the session on a positive note, managing to settle above the 25,000 mark for the first time. However, the market breadth remains restrained, with limited support from the bulls, indicating a sign of timidity. From a technical standpoint, for Nifty, 24,800 remains the crucial support zone, where buying is anticipated to emerge, followed by the sacrosanct support of the 24,600-24,500 zone. On the higher end, as per experts, 25,080-25,100 appears to be an intermediate obstacle. However, this morning global cues are extremely weak with Nasdaq tumbling over 2% overnight and Nikkei clocking deep cuts of ove 5%. The GIFT Nifty is also hinting at a negative start for the Indian market. Among stocks in focus, watch out for Tata Motors, ITC, Eicher, Hero Moto, Titan & Britannia.

"Live: Can Nifty defend 25,000 amid global selloff? Ola Electric IPO opens | Opening Bell","Indian equity market opened with a gap-up above the 25,000 milestone. Despite gradually losing momentum, the Nifty50 index concluded the session on a positive note, managing to settle above the 25,000 mark for the first time. However, the market breadth remains restrained, with limited support from the bulls, indicating a sign of timidity. From a technical standpoint, for Nifty, 24,800 remains the crucial support zone, where buying is anticipated to emerge, followed by the sacrosanct support of the 24,600-24,500 zone. On the higher end, as per experts, 25,080-25,100 appears to be an intermediate obstacle. However, this morning global cues are extremely weak with Nasdaq tumbling over 2% overnight and Nikkei clocking deep cuts of ove 5%. The GIFT Nifty is also hinting at a negative start for the Indian market. Among stocks in focus, watch out for Tata Motors, ITC, Eicher, Hero Moto, Titan & Britannia.

Despite gradually losing momentum, the Nifty50 index concluded the session on a positive note, managing to settle above the 25,000 mark for the first time. However, the market breadth remains restrained, with limited support from the bulls, indicating a sign of timidity. From a technical standpoint, for Nifty, 24,800 remains the crucial support zone, where buying is anticipated to emerge, followed by the sacrosanct support of the 24,600-24,500 zone. On the higher end, as per experts, 25,080-25,100 appears to be an intermediate obstacle. However, this morning global cues are extremely weak with Nasdaq tumbling over 2% overnight and Nikkei clocking deep cuts of ove 5%.

"Live: Can Nifty defend 25,000 amid global selloff? Ola Electric IPO opens | Opening Bell","Indian equity market opened with a gap-up above the 25,000 milestone. Despite gradually losing momentum, the Nifty50 index concluded the session on a positive note, managing to settle above the 25,000 mark for the first time. However, the market breadth remains restrained, with limited support from the bulls, indicating a sign of timidity. From a technical standpoint, for Nifty, 24,800 remains the crucial support zone, where buying is anticipated to emerge, followed by the sacrosanct support of the 24,600-24,500 zone. On the higher end, as per experts, 25,080-25,100 appears to be an intermediate obstacle. However, this morning global cues are extremely weak with Nasdaq tumbling over 2% overnight and Nikkei clocking deep cuts of ove 5%. The GIFT Nifty is also hinting at a negative start for the Indian market. Among stocks in focus, watch out for Tata Motors, ITC, Eicher, Hero Moto, Titan & Britannia.

"Live: Can Nifty defend 25,000 amid global selloff? Ola Electric IPO opens | Opening Bell","Indian equity market opened with a gap-up above the 25,000 milestone. Despite gradually losing momentum, the Nifty50 index concluded the session on a positive note, managing to settle above the 25,000 mark for the first time. However, the market breadth remains restrained, with limited support from the bulls, indicating a sign of timidity. From a technical standpoint, for Nifty, 24,800 remains the crucial support zone, where buying is anticipated to emerge, followed by the sacrosanct support of the 24,600-24,500 zone. On the higher end, as per experts, 25,080-25,100 appears to be an intermediate obstacle. However, this morning global cues are extremely weak with Nasdaq tumbling over 2% overnight and Nikkei clocking deep cuts of ove 5%. The GIFT Nifty is also hinting at a negative start for the Indian market. Among stocks in focus, watch out for Tata Motors, ITC, Eicher, Hero Moto, Titan & Britannia.

Adani shares in focus|Opening Bell,"Indian equity market closed one percent higher after a gap-up opening on Friday but failed to sustain above the short-term moving averages (10 and 21-day EMA), which coincides with the 24,400 mark.

Live: Hindenburg allegations against SEBI chief to hit sentiment? Adani shares in focus|Opening Bell,"Indian equity market closed one percent higher after a gap-up opening on Friday but failed to sustain above the short-term moving averages (10 and 21-day EMA), which coincides with the 24,400 mark. This is a crucial level to watch for further upside towards 24,700, the upper end of the bearish gap created on August 5. If the index fails to close and sustain above 24,400, consolidation may continue with support at the 24,100-24,000 zone, according to experts. The Nifty 50 finished the week 1.4 percent down at 24,368. This morning GIFT Nifty is hinting at a mildly negative start. Investors will be watching out for any reaction to the Hindenburg allegations against SEBI chief Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband saying that they had stakes in offshore funds used by the Adani group.  Among stocks in focus, watch out for Adani Group stocks, Jubilant Foodworks, Honasa, Bharat Dynamics and Mazagon Dock.
