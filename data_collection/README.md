Economy and Stock News Scraper
Overview
This script scrapes news articles related to the economy from a specific page of the MoneyControl website and appends the data to an existing CSV file. The articles are stored with their titles and descriptions in a structured format.

Prerequisites:
    Python 3.x
    Required Python packages:
          requests
          beautifulsoup4
          pandas
          Installation
Clone the repository (if applicable):
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/economy-news-scraper.git
cd economy-news-scraper

Install the required Python packages:
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas

Usage
Modify the script if necessary:
The URL defined in the script fetches news articles from page 20 of the MoneyControl website's economy section. You can change the page number in the URL to scrape different pages.

Run the script:
python economy_news_scraper.py

Check the output:
The scraped data will be appended to the economy_news.csv file located at /content/economy_news.csv. If the file does not exist, it will be created.

Script Explanation
URL and Headers:
The script begins by defining the URL of the webpage to scrape and the necessary headers to mimic a real browser request.

Webpage Fetching and Parsing:
The script fetches the webpage content using the requests library and parses it using BeautifulSoup.

Data Extraction:
The script navigates through the HTML structure of the page to locate the relevant news articles. It extracts the title and description of each article.

Data Storage:
The extracted data is stored in a list, converted to a Pandas DataFrame, and then appended to an existing CSV file (economy_news.csv). If the file doesn't exist, a new one is created.

Error Handling
The script includes checks to ensure that the expected HTML elements are found before attempting to extract data. If any of these elements are not found, an appropriate message is printed to the console.

Example Output
A sample entry in the CSV file might look like this:

Title	Description
"Economy on the Rise"	"The economy is expected to grow by 7% this year, according to ..."
"New Policies Announced"	"The government has introduced new economic policies aimed at ..."
