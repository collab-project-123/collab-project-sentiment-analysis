This file merges all models together to predict the values based on the inputs, but before this file you will have to run python code from sentiment analysis dir and download
saved models from compvsNifty and nasdaqVsnifty. running this file will compile outputs from all these saved models and give an output using weighted prediction average.

P.S. this file contains directory calling for model use, machine to machine these might change so make changes accordingly.
