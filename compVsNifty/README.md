      whole pyhton code for machine learning is stored there, only use this file to look at code.
## compVsnifty.csv:
      this is the dataset used to train the model.
## xgboost_model_compVsnifty.pkl:
      this is where the model is stored after training and building, this can be be used to call the model for prediction.
## XG_call_comp.ipynb:
      this is whole python code  should be used to call the saved model for prediction.
